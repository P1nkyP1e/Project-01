# Aloha project
This is a project to showcase HTML and CSS to build a responsive website as part of a Web Development Program at RED Academy.
I have learnt a great deal during this project.
Using proper Mark up for my html and css properties.
Also, used "smooth scrolling" in the menu, Flickty/jquery for my carousel.
Implemented an alert box for subscription.
Used flexbox and their properties.
I tried to optimized my layout with the use of required breakpoints for implementing mobile first layout.
My biggest lesson was remembering to save my work as as i go along. As i lost so must progress in not saving my work.
In say so, i could done a lot better by remembering to save my work.
